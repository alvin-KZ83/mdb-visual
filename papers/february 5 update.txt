1. sensei wants it to be every target demographic because then everyone can participate (seems like a long run thing)
2. signaling vs expressing became a difficult topic to grasp (max and sensei are of the expressing faction, i and Shimizu(?) are of the signaling faction
3. hiding has not been discussed well yet, sensei doesn't see hiding as a thing at all

1. max is gonna be busy out of the whole deal, and sadly, the whole discussion was not of roles and instead became do we do posters/demo or both answer: poster
2. prototyping wise, it became more of finishing the poster and the paper

Shimizu showed his work on th overleaf, we were in the wrong
The pilot test we have can be used, but a mistake was made where the target demographic was not done at all, so either redo it or recollect the demographic
The followup survey should be done soon and analyzed even quicker

the question of color will be a very dangerous topic to tread on, so that is still up for discussion

the next meeting will be at 6pm on the 10th of February
